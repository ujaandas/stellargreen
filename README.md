Qs:

1. Clicking on shapefiles returns 'undefined' or misenconded data --> is this my fault
   or something to do with how they were collected? Cannot fetch name without this
2. Difference between HK_Pro and HK_Shapefile?
   2.5. AGB looks weird? Why so different across years?
3. Missing Kadoorie farm shapefile
4. How to render different parts of Bhutan/Junshan? ie; 062019, 042019, 032019, etc...
5. Carbon stock? Land cover? Vegetation?
6. AGB/other stats for other regions beyond Kadoorie?
7. Where to get overview and other data? images?
